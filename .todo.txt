Main todo:
- Finish fight feature!
- Fix render order bug with characters
- Implement tile layers (adds possibility to make bridges, stairs)
- TileData: for performance, make "flags" string *really* flags, like, an enum or Nz::Flags
- AISystem "!move.playerInitiated and no path found (something blocked and still blocking)"
- Add RandomMovementComponent to entities
	Bugs:
	- Weird animation walk (animutil?)
	- Character standing instead of moving (obstacle?)
	- todo: prefer tiles with the exact range

UI Todo:
- Fix menu bar ("spell bar") not appearing
