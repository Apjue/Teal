- Fix raycasting [Not a Teal/raycasting bug: graphics bug, update nazara when patch will be released]
- Use LuaImpl* in tealinit.cpp (& others places, i.e. everywhere)
  
- Maybe implement LuaImplReplyVal in nzstlcompatibility, for std::(unordered_)map
- Maybe also (not sure):
    - in characterdata
    - in mapdata
