Main todo:
- Put inventory items in spellbar
- Fix weird animation with entities using RandomMovementSystem (related to "Width must be at least 1 (0)" Nz::Texture error?)
- NPCs's orientations must be refreshed before changing map
- Handle character overall speed, not only animation speed
- Finish fight feature!

- AISystem "!move.playerInitiated and no path found (something blocked and still blocking)"
- Handle blocktiles in TilesetCore
- Implement tile layers (adds possibility to make bridges, stairs)
